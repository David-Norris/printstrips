This is the original README provided with this software.

I have modified the original files slightly to cope with newer versions of php 
and to cope with url encoded data

You need a copy of the fpdf libraries for installation. They can be
located at 'www.fpdf.org'. Installation of these libraries is beyond
the scope of this document.

Copy all of the files in this archive to the same directory in a folder
accessable by your web server. This folder must be able to run php
scripts.

You will need to edit printscripts.php. The first define and require
lines need to point to the appropriate locations of these files on
your system.
